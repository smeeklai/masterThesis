Installing
----------

First, make sure you have all the requirements listed in the "Requirements" section.

Then, easily install the original version of the library using ``pip install SpeechRecognition``.
Otherwise, download the source distribution from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/>`__, and extract the archive.
In the folder, run ``python setup.py install``.

Next, using any free FTP software such as `FileZilla <https://filezilla-project.org/>`__ to connect and access files and folders in Raspberry Pi. After you are able to access Raspberry Pi, replacing original __init__.py file in the original library located in ``usr/local/lib/python[your python version]/dist-package/speech_recognition`` with the modified __init__.py file in speech_recognition folder downloaded from this github

Congratulation! You've completed installation and free to have a quick try by running ``python script2.py``

Requirements
------------

To use all of the functionality of the library, you should have:

* **Python** 2.6 or 2.7 (required)
* **PyAudio** 0.2.9+ (required only if you need to use microphone input, ``Microphone``)
* **PocketSphinx** (required only if you need to use the Sphinx recognizer, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_sphinx``)
* **FLAC encoder** (required only if the system is not x86-based Windows/Linux/OS X)

**Below advices are not important if you do not intend to use them**
The following requirements are optional, but can improve or extend functionality in some situations:

* On Python 2, and only on Python 2, some functions (like ``recognizer_instance.recognize_bing``) will run slower if you do not have **Monotonic for Python 2** installed.
* If using CMU Sphinx, you may want to `install additional language packs <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/pocketsphinx.rst#installing-other-languages>`__ to support languages like International French or Mandarin Chinese.

The following sections go over the details of each requirement.

Python
~~~~~~

The modified version of the library requirement is `Python 2.6 or 2.7 <https://www.python.org/download/releases/>`__. This is required to use the library.

PyAudio (for microphone users)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`PyAudio <http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/#downloads>`__ is required if and only if you want to use microphone input (``Microphone``). PyAudio version 0.2.9+ is required, as earlier versions have overflow issues with recording on certain machines.

If not installed, everything in the library will still work, except attempting to instantiate a ``Microphone`` object will throw an ``AttributeError``.

The installation instructions are quite good as of PyAudio v0.2.9. For convenience, they are summarized below:

* On Windows, install PyAudio using `Pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__: execute ``pip install pyaudio`` in a terminal.
* On Debian-derived Linux distributions (like Ubuntu and Mint), install PyAudio using `APT <https://wiki.debian.org/Apt>`__: execute ``sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio`` in a terminal.
    * If the version in the repositories is too old, install the latest release using Pip: execute ``sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev python3-all-dev && sudo pip install pyaudio`` (replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if using Python 3).
* On OS X, install PortAudio using `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__: ``brew install portaudio && sudo brew link portaudio``. Then, install PyAudio using `Pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__: ``pip install pyaudio``.
* On other POSIX-based systems, install the ``portaudio19-dev`` and ``python-all-dev`` (or ``python3-all-dev`` if using Python 3) packages (or their closest equivalents) using a package manager of your choice, and then install PyAudio using `Pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__: ``pip install pyaudio`` (replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if using Python 3).

PyAudio `wheel packages <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`__ for 64-bit Python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 on Windows and Linux are included for convenience, under the ``third-party/`` `directory <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition/tree/master/third-party>`__ in the repository root. To install, simply run ``pip install wheel`` followed by ``pip install ./third-party/WHEEL_FILENAME`` (replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if using Python 3) in the repository `root directory <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition>`__.

PocketSphinx-Python (for Sphinx users)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`PocketSphinx-Python <https://github.com/bambocher/pocketsphinx-python>`__ is **required if and only if you want to use the Sphinx recognizer** (``recognizer_instance.recognize_sphinx``).

PocketSphinx-Python `wheel packages <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`__ for 64-bit Python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5 on Windows are included for convenience, under the ``third-party/`` `directory <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition/tree/master/third-party>`__. To install, simply run ``pip install wheel`` followed by ``pip install ./third-party/WHEEL_FILENAME`` (replace ``pip`` with ``pip3`` if using Python 3) in the SpeechRecognition folder.

On Linux and other POSIX systems (such as OS X), follow the instructions under "Building PocketSphinx-Python from source" in `Notes on using PocketSphinx <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/pocketsphinx.rst>`__ for installation instructions.

Note that the versions available in most package repositories are outdated and will not work with the bundled language data. Using the bundled wheel packages or building from source is recommended.

See `Notes on using PocketSphinx <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition/blob/master/reference/pocketsphinx.rst>`__ for information about installing languages, compiling PocketSphinx, and building language packs from online resources. This document is also included under ``reference/pocketsphinx.rst``.

FLAC (for some systems)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `FLAC encoder <https://xiph.org/flac/>`__ is required to encode the audio data to send to the API. If using Windows (x86 or x86-64), OS X (Intel Macs only, OS X 10.6 or higher), or Linux (x86 or x86-64), this is **already bundled with this library - you do not need to install anything**.

Otherwise, ensure that you have the ``flac`` command line tool, which is often available through the system package manager.

The included ``flac-win32`` executable is the `official FLAC 1.3.1 32-bit Windows binary <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/flac/flac-1.3.1-win.zip>`__.

The included ``flac-linux-x86`` executable is built from the `FLAC 1.3.1 source code <http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/flac/flac-1.3.1.tar.xz>`__ with `Manylinux <https://github.com/pypa/manylinux>`__ to ensure that it's compatible with a wide variety of distributions. The exact commands used are:

.. code:: bash

    # download and extract the FLAC source code
    wget http://downloads.xiph.org/releases/flac/flac-1.3.1.tar.xz
    tar xf flac-1.3.1.tar.xz
    sudo apt-get install --yes docker.io
    sudo docker run --tty --interactive --rm --volume "$(pwd):/root" quay.io/pypa/manylinux1_i686:latest bash # download and start a shell inside the Manylinux environment

    # we're now in a Bash shell inside the Manylinux Docker image
    cd /root/flac-1.3.1
    ./configure LDFLAGS=-static # compiler flags to make a static build
    make
    exit # return to the original shell

The resulting executable can then be found at ``./flac-1.3.1/src/flac`` relative to the working directory. A copy of the source code can also be found at ``third-party/flac-1.3.1.tar.xz``. The build should be bit-for-bit reproducible.

The included ``flac-mac`` executable is extracted from `xACT 2.37 <http://xact.scottcbrown.org/>`__, which is a frontend for FLAC that conveniently includes binaries for all of its encoders. Specifically, it is a copy of ``xACT 2.37/xACT.app/Contents/Resources/flac`` in ``xACT2.37.zip``.

Monotonic for Python 2 (for faster operations in some functions on Python 2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Python 2, and only on Python 2, if you do not install the `Monotonic for Python 2 <https://github.com/atdt/monotonic>`__ library, some functions will run slower than they otherwise could (though everything will still work correctly).

On Python 3, that library's functionality is built into the Python standard library, which makes it unnecessary.

This is because monotonic time is necessary to handle cache expiry properly in the face of system time changes and other time-related issues. If monotonic time functionality is not available, then things like access token requests will not be cached.

To install, use `Pip <https://pip.readthedocs.org/>`__: execute ``pip install monotonic`` in a terminal.

Executing
----------

1) First of all, setting up a wireless network. If you already have your network set up, for example, your home WiFi or lab WiFi. You can just skip this step
2) Connect the Raspberry Pi to the network via LAN cable
3) If you also want to use smartglasses, connect the smartglasses to the network as well. If not, skip this step
4) Find a way for yourself to know the Raspberry Pi IP address
5) Access to Raspberry Pi by doing SSH. **Make sure your laptop/PC is in the same network with Raspberry Pi**
6) Access to `boss\main_files` folder and run `python script2.py`

**Note that** if you also want to show outputs on smartglasses, after running the script, enable the smartglasses mode. However, in order to run this mode without errors, you must know the IP addresses of your smartglasses and your router.

Troubleshooting
---------------

The recognizer tries to recognize speech even when I'm not speaking.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try increasing the ``recognizer_instance.energy_threshold`` property. This is basically how sensitive the recognizer is to when recognition should start. Higher values mean that it will be less sensitive, which is useful if you are in a loud room.

This value depends entirely on your microphone or audio data. There is no one-size-fits-all value, but good values typically range from 50 to 4000.

The recognizer can't recognize speech right after it starts listening for the first time.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``recognizer_instance.energy_threshold`` property is probably set to a value that is too high to start off with, and then being adjusted lower automatically by dynamic energy threshold adjustment. Before it is at a good level, the energy threshold is so high that speech is just considered ambient noise.

The solution is to decrease this threshold, or call ``recognizer_instance.adjust_for_ambient_noise`` beforehand, which will set the threshold to a good value automatically.

The recognizer doesn't understand my particular language/dialect.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try setting the recognition language to your language/dialect. To do this, see the documentation for ``recognizer_instance.recognize_sphinx``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_google``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_wit``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_bing``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_api``, and ``recognizer_instance.recognize_ibm``.

For example, if your language/dialect is British English, it is better to use ``"en-GB"`` as the language rather than ``"en-US"``.

The code examples throw ``UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character`` when run.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you're using Python 2, and your language uses non-ASCII characters, and the terminal or file-like object you're printing to only supports ASCII, an error is thrown when trying to write non-ASCII characters.

This is because in Python 2, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_sphinx``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_google``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_wit``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_bing``, ``recognizer_instance.recognize_api``, and ``recognizer_instance.recognize_ibm`` return unicode strings (``u"something"``) rather than byte strings (``"something"``). In Python 3, all strings are unicode strings.

To make printing of unicode strings work in Python 2 as well, replace all print statements in your code of the following form:

    .. code:: python

        print SOME_UNICODE_STRING

With the following:

    .. code:: python

        print SOME_UNICODE_STRING.encode("utf8")

This change, however, will prevent the code from working in Python 3.

The program doesn't run when compiled with `PyInstaller <https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki>`__.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As of PyInstaller version 3.0, SpeechRecognition is supported out of the box. If you're getting weird issues when compiling your program using PyInstaller, simply update PyInstaller.

You can easily do this by running ``pip install --upgrade pyinstaller``.

On Ubuntu/Debian, I get errors like "jack server is not running or cannot be started" or "Cannot lock down [...] byte memory area (Cannot allocate memory)".
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Linux audio stack is pretty fickle. There are a few things that can cause these issues.

First, make sure JACK is installed - to install it, run ``sudo apt-get install multimedia-jack``

You will then want to configure the JACK daemon correctly to avoid that "Cannot allocate memory" error. Run ``sudo dpkg-reconfigure -p high jackd2`` and select "Yes" to do so.

Now, you will want to make sure your current user is in the ``audio`` group. You can add your current user to this group by running ``sudo adduser $(whoami) audio``.

Unfortunately, these changes will require you to reboot before they take effect.

After rebooting, run ``pulseaudio --kill``, followed by ``jack_control start``, to fix the "jack server is not running or cannot be started" error.

On Ubuntu/Debian, I get annoying output in the terminal saying things like "bt_audio_service_open: [...] Connection refused" and various others.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The "bt_audio_service_open" error means that you have a Bluetooth audio device, but as a physical device is not currently connected, we can't actually use it - if you're not using a Bluetooth microphone, then this can be safely ignored. If you are, and audio isn't working, then double check to make sure your microphone is actually connected. There does not seem to be a simple way to disable these messages.

For errors of the form "ALSA lib [...] Unknown PCM", see `this StackOverflow answer <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7088672/pyaudio-working-but-spits-out-error-messages-each-time>`__. Basically, to get rid of an error of the form "Unknown PCM cards.pcm.rear", simply comment out ``pcm.rear cards.pcm.rear`` in ``/usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf``, ``~/.asoundrc``, and ``/etc/asound.conf``.

On OS X, I get a ``ChildProcessError`` saying that it couldn't find the system FLAC converter, even though it's installed.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing `FLAC for OS X <https://xiph.org/flac/download.html>`__ directly from the source code will not work, since it doesn't correctly add the executables to the search path.

Installing FLAC using `Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`__ ensures that the search path is correctly updated. First, ensure you have Homebrew, then run ``brew install flac`` to install the necessary files.

Developing
----------

To hack on this library, first make sure you have all the requirements listed in the "Requirements" section.

-  Most of the library code lives in ``speech_recognition/__init__.py``.
-  Examples live under the ``examples/`` `directory <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition/tree/master/examples>`__, and the demo script lives in ``speech_recognition/__main__.py``.
-  The FLAC encoder binaries are in the ``speech_recognition/`` `directory <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition/tree/master/speech_recognition>`__.
-  Documentation can be found in the ``reference/`` `directory <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition/tree/master/reference>`__.
-  Third-party libraries, utilities, and reference material are in the ``third-party/`` `directory <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition/tree/master/third-party>`__.

To install/reinstall the library locally, run ``python setup.py install`` in the project `root directory <https://github.com/smeeklai/masterThesis/speech_recognition>`__.

Releases are done by running either ``build.sh`` or ``build.bat``. These are bash and batch scripts, respectively, that automatically build Python source packages and `Python Wheels <http://pythonwheels.com/>`__, then upload them to PyPI.

Features and bugfixes should be tested, at minimum, on Python 2.7 and a recent version of Python 3. It is highly recommended to test new features on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and the latest version of Python 3.
